Review: I’m not sure where to start. Should I mention the incredible sound quality? Comfort? Adjustable bass slider? Or the battery life?I bought these headphones several months ago with the intention of using them at the gym, but I ended up using them mostly for listening to audiobooks and podcasts. Sounds quality has been good for that and the comfort allows me to wear them for hours at a time.Recently, I got a record player with Bluetooth capabilities so while I wait for my RCA receiver and speakers, I’ve been using the Evo Crushers.If you want a fully immersive experience with your music, if you want to be completely engulfed in your favorite songs with the perfect amount of bass, you want this headset. From Hozier, to Lindsey Sterling, to Billie Eilish, these headphones will transport you INTO your music.The wireless connectivity is quick and easy on any device I’ve tried thus far including my iPhone, my computer and now my Sony Record Player. The quality is sturdy and they don’t feel flimsy or cheap at all. I spent more on my Beats wireless headphones and didn’t get near the quality I have from the Evo Crushers. Functionally, they are easy to use. I figured out the buttons easily without having to read the manual.Additionally, the battery life is incredible! They’re advertised to have a 40hr battery life but I got these in I think June? And the only time I have charged them was in June. When they first came out of the box. I use them at least 3-4 days a week for a few hours and have yet to need to charge them. Battery is still at 60%. I’m not a frequent reviewer of the things I buy but these needed to be bragged on! I’m suggesting them to all of my friends. No regrets on this purchase whatsoever.

Review: I know Skullcandy has a lot of competition these days and used to be probably a bit "bigger" on the market, but they continue to make a quality product. What I like about these: they are not huge like some OE phones but they are still very comfortable, the bass in these is fantastic, the charge on these is amazing, lasts a long time, and the noise cancelling is also fantastic. I was lucky to get them on a "Prime Day deal" so I'm very happy with the price, but if you're looking for something reliable, quality, and comfortable, even the regular price is pretty competitive with what is out there.

Review: I love these head phones. Excellent value for a decent price! These head phones have it all!! Amazing sound. Adjustable base. You can track them in case you lose them. The charge is c style so easy to buy more. They come with a head phone jack so they can be used for gaming. Setting them up and using them via blue tooth is a breeze. I only wish they had more colors because now I'm going to buy one for everyone in my family!!

Review: The Skullcandy Crusher Evo Wireless Headphones are fantastic! They fit perfectly and are super comfortable for long listening sessions. The sound quality is crisp and clear, and the sensory bass feature adds a whole new level to my music experience.The design looks great, and the battery life is impressive, lasting up to 40 hours on a single charge. They connect easily via Bluetooth and work seamlessly with both my iPhone and Android devices. If you’re looking for headphones with great sound, comfort, and style, I highly recommend these!

Review: My Indy ANC earbuds crapped out after a few years and I finally admitted it was time to buy new headphones so I opted for these. Great price, but the lack of active noise cancelling was something I overlooked when I purchased these and I'm a little disappointed that I don't have it anymore.HOWEVERThe sound quality is fantastic and ability to increase the level of bass drowns out any other sounds for the most part. Almost makes them feel like they should be more expensive. There is a minor element of noise cancelling (can't think of what they call it) which works well enough when you're listening to something. It's good enough that I cannot make out what my gf is saying when she's sitting on the other side of the couch. And that's without having anything playing.Connecting is simple and they're much easier to use than my old earbuds because there are physical buttons. I'll be keeping them because I destroyed the box when I opened them, but moving away from active noise cancelling after having it for years will be an adjustment. Will edit my review after an upcoming flight. I'm interested to see how they do on a plane.

Review: Three or four years ago, I bought the Crusher ANC headphones for my kid for $300 and they were amazing until I dropped them. I owed him a pair of headphones and we couldn't find the originals anymore so I ordered the ANC 2 headphones and they sucked! We just couldn't get the EQ adjusted right to make the music sound as good as it did on the original Crusher ANC headphones. We researched the problem and found that the originals had "sensory bass" and the ANC 2 headphones did not.I found that these headphones do have the sensory bass and after hearing music through them, this is exactly what we were missing with the ANC 2. I listen to a lot of EDM and the default settings with the bass slider all the way down really gives me the sound that I'm looking for. I rarely slide it up and if I do, I only slide it up a tiny bit. For me, sliding it up too much adds so much bass, the songs sound a little muddy. But no problem because the default settings are so good.These aren't as good as the Crusher ANC original, but we can't get those new anymore and these aren't $300 either. These headphones are great for the money and I bought two more pairs to give as xmas presents.

Review: Comentaré de inmediato la característica principal de por qué para mí son lo mejor, por sobre otras opciones (y en particular en comparación con unos Sony WH-XB910N Extra Bass, de los que también soy usuario). Y es que al usarlos conectados con un cable auxiliar (incluido) tienes un 99% de FUNCIONALIDAD EN AUDIO Y MICRÓFONO. Es decir, imagina que se quedan sin batería en medio de una llamada/videollamada y tienes que usar el cable auxiliar, los conectas y puedes usarlos sin ningún problema... el headset es funcional a la perfección cuando están apagados o sin batería, en comparación con otros audífonos bluetooth que he usado -cof! Sony cof!-, que solo dan el audio pero el micrófono queda inutilizado.¿Por qué digo que tienen un 99% de funcionalidad en el modo cable auxiliar? Cuando están conectados de esta forma, no es posible usar el Sensory Bass, función característica de estos audífonos. ¿Y qué es el Sensory Bass (Graves sensoriales ajustables)? Es un botón graduable que hace que dé la sensación de que estás escuchando unos bajos superpotentes, y digo sensación porque yo creo que es simplemente artificial, es solo un "rumble" como el de un control-joystick de consola y no es vibración real del sonido (es mi percepción).Tomando en cuenta el uso de oficina que les doy, es decir, escuchar música mientras hago labores diarias y/o atender videollamadas, estos han sido la mejor opción por la característica ya mencionada. Son una excelente compra.De ahí en fuera...El sonido y funcionalidad son muy similares. La cancelación de ruido, que solo la da por su diseño over-ear y sus almohadillas de memory foam, es decente. La duración de la batería es sobresaliente, pero depende del uso y si tienes activado el "rumbling".

Review: La calidad de sonido es increíble y se notan buenos materiales. Almohadillas cómodas y se puede configurar los grabes por la app o en los mismos cascos. Un acierto de compra.
